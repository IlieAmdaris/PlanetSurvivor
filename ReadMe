Due to popular demand Planet Survivor 2 was developed with many new exciting features:
1.We added a wide variety of OSTs, 2, to be more precise;
2.Because many players found it hard to play for more than 3 seconds, when the RND was gracious, we increased the knight 
health and the number of uses of the hatchet;
Also works for testing purposes *wink*.
3.We added a magic spell that slows down the enemies;
4.We added a special hatchet, that is green and also when used destroys all the enemies. It is so powerful in fact, that it doesn't even need to strike
the planet to destroy them.It is that powerful, all regular enemies die the moment it is raised;
5.A brand new enemy, that is different from the previous one. It is red..faster, bigger and this makes it trully gruesome, also it isn't affected by anything other than the hatchet,
but most importantly it has an entirely different lore. To balance things out it is also easier to knock out of the planet and it has a slower spawn rate
to keep things balanced.
